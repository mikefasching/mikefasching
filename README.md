### Hi there 👋  I’m Michael Fasching

**AI Engineer • Researcher • Data Enthusiast**

- 🔭  I’m building secure and **responsible AI systems** — from copyright-safe LLM agents to 3-D diffusion models that synthesize rare-tumor MRI scans.  
- 📚  Graduate researcher (GPA 4.0) at Binghamton University working on evolutionary clustering, model certification, and medical imaging.  
- 🛠  Daily toolkit: `Python`, `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow`, `Hugging Face`, `SQL`, `Spark`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `AWS SageMaker`, `Vertex AI`, `Terraform`, `Tableau`, `Power BI`.  
- 🌱  Currently diving deeper into **retrieval-augmented generation, adversarial robustness, and scalable MLOps**.  
- 🤝  Always open to collaborating on open-source projects that advance **ethical AI** or improve **data-driven healthcare**.  
- 🏃‍♂️  When not coding, you’ll find me training for triathlons or mentoring students in NLP and machine learning.  
- 😄  On this GitHub you’ll find code, notebooks, and papers that turn data and theory into working solutions. Let’s create knowledge together!
